## Introduction 
 * Tic-tac-toe, also known as noughts and crosses, is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players. It is usually played on paper but as the technology evolved, here is a digital version of it.

## Research
### Tic-tac-toe Game Features and Benefits
It is often used as a pedagogical tool for teaching the concepts of good sportsmanship and the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the searching of game trees. It is straightforward to write a computer program to play tic-tac-toe perfectly or to enumerate the 765 essentially different positions (the state space complexity) or the 26,830 possible games up to rotations and reflections (the game tree complexity) on this space. If played optimally by both players, the game always ends in a draw, making tic-tac-toe a futile game.

    * Player 2 plays with 'O', and enter the no. which place want to select.
* The game ends when:
    * It is in a draw situation , i.e, a total of 9 moves have been completed and nobody has won.
    * Player 1 win.
    * Player 2 wins.
* The game continues in the beginning if the check for draw is false.
* Then it checks if anyone has won yet.
* If not, then it again checks if it is a draw situation.
